* Final project

Add your final project files here. Remember
- You must have a pdf file with your actual submission
- You can add other files as needed (in any format you'd like)
- Every participant must upload the same pdf file

Write up in an .md or .pdf file (I'd prefer .md) a proposal for what
you want to do for your final project. The project is to be done by
groups of two (and one group of 3).
Include:
1. The names of the participants.
2. A description of the issue you are going to tackle
3. A description of how you will provide a program as part of the
   project (which can be in any language, even untraditional ones like
   using a spreadsheet for data analysis)
Make sure that all group members have a copy of this file in their
repo.
