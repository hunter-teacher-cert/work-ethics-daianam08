## Issue: Social media addiction
Revealing the ways that social media is addictive

## Program description
We are thinking of two ideas depending on the level of difficulty of the task. We were thinking either create a Buzzfeed-style quiz where a series of questions are asked and depending on the score, you get a measurement of your social media addiction, OR create a game where the higher your score is (gaining social media influence points by doing certain tasks) the more addicted you may be to social media.This will perhaps help the player think about their interaction with social media and at the end provide the user with helpful links should they need to address their addiction. The first proposal would be done in HTML, CSS, and JS, but the second one could be done the same way or perhaps using Java and leveraging object orientation.
