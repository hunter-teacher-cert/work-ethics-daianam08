Continue Python Review. You can use the resources listed on our web page (I like both Automate The Boring Stuff and the online textbook) or any other resource - there are tons of things out there.

Create one or more Python programs in your week_01_python folder that exhibit your knowledge of Python including functions, lists and dictionaries.

You can rewrite one or more of your programs from the summer. Here are suggestions but you can also do something new or different, just check with me. I'd also advise you to start small and test all along the way - don't try to convert a BIG program all at once - it won't work. Do a bit at a time.

The game of life program (without the animation) covers most of the array/list concepts you'll want to be comfortable with in this class so that would be a good end goal for everything but dictionaries.

For dictionaries you can write a program that reads a file and uses a dictionary to count the number of times each word appears.
