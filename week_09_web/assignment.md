For this site you will make a web site and host it on GitHub. The site could be for class page, a personal site, or anything else. The site must include a form (although the form won't actually do anything) and at least one image but can include anything and everything else. You can and are encouraged to work with a partner.

I surveyed you a while ago on your HTML/CSS backgrounds and will expect something commensurate with your knowledge. Not in terms of size but in terms of what you use. That is, brand new people will have much more bare bones sites and that's fine. I would love for you to take the week to stretch yourself a bit - try something new.

I do not expect any javascript for this assignment, just HTML and CSS. You are to make the web site in a GitHub repository. In the file websites.md put links to:
1. The repo that's holding the web site code (and location if it's not
   the only thing there).
2. The live website.
3. The name of your partner if you're working with one.

Here are four videos to get you started. The first covers setting up the GitHub repo, the second basic HTML, then CSS, then more advanced CSS.
